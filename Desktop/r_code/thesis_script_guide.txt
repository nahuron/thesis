Function/Script Notes

1. community_sorter.r— generates binary community matrix from coordinate data with a specific decimal degree grid size
2. microendemic_localities.txt— generates additional coordinate presence points from presence points and a raster of the geographical area of interest. 
Coordinate points are adjacent to the input coordinates or surround the input coordinates based on the adjacency type. A subsample of possible adjacent
points can be selected if the snumber argument is smaller than the total number of points produced. Results can be saved as CSV files to a directory of
the user's choosing.
3. phylostruct_revised.txt— alternative version of the phylostruct that has an extra null community builder option: null communities are built with the
community.simulator function (sim_coms.txt)
4. sim_coms.txt— function that devises null communities from a species list. The user sets the minimum and maximum possible number of species/community
and the requested number of null communities. The output matrix is a binary community matrix and can be saved as a CSV
5. species_sorter.txt— function that separates coordinate data by species and saves new CSV files for the coordinates for each species
